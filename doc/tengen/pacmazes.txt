MS. PAC-MAN (NES) MAZE DATA FORMAT - v1.0 - 8/6/99
--------------------------------------------------

-------------------------

Please excuse any goof-ups, this is my first attempt at writing a technical
doc. The whole thing's probably written very badly. Bleh. =P

Before you start hacking the mazes, you might want to print out a list of all
the maze wall/dot tiles and their associated hex values. It'll help, trust me.


Data locations & byte values
----------------------------
In the .NES file, the maze data starts at $2F08 (byte value is 45), and ends
at $5F0F (byte value is FF). Each byte in this range will be one of the
following values:

00-0F (maze walls, dots)
40-7F (maze walls)
82-8C (repeat byte)
FF    (end of maze)

Hex value FF defines the end of a maze's data. It tells the maze drawing
routine to stop reading data, and assemble the maze.


In-game maze layout
-------------------
In the game itself, every maze is 28 tiles wide. The height of the maze will
vary depending on which maze type you choose in the main menu (ARCADE, MINI,
BIG, or STRANGE). Every maze is mirrored left-right.


Data compression
----------------
Ms. Pac-Man uses two simple forms of compression to store its mazes
efficiently.

Compression, part 1
--------------------
In the ROM, each line of the maze is actually 14 tiles wide. The game program
mirrors each line of tiles left-right, except:

1. tiles in the range 40-5F will be changed to 60-7F, and vice versa
2. tiles in the range 00-0F will be left alone (they work on either side)

Compression, part 2
-------------------
To save even more space, strings of identical tiles (the bottom of the maze,
long horizontal rows of dots) are reduced to two bytes. The first byte
(ranging from 82-8D) defines how many times the next byte (tile) will be
repeated (82 = 3 times, 83 = 4 times, 84 = 5 times, etc). Example:

01 01 01 01 01 01

would be stored as

85 01 (repeat tile #01 6 times)

A bigger example:

46 02 02 02 02 4A 6A 02 02 02 02 02 02 02

would be stored as

46 83 02 4A 6A 86 02

(Using both compression methods, that's 28 on-screen tiles compressed into 7
bytes! Wow!)


Putting the data together
-------------------------
Let's review what we've learned, shall we? The following is the first row of
the first maze of ARCADE mode:

45 85 01 68 48 84 01

We decipher it into:

tile 45, tile 01 repeated 6x, tile 68, tile 48, tile 01 repeated 5x

or, a bad ASCII example:

Ú------·Ö-----

Mirrored left-right, we get the top row of maze 1:

Ú------·Ö----------·Ö------¿

Easy, no?

When hacking the maze data, remember that there is no break between the lines
of data for each line of the maze (each maze is stored in one L O N G string).
You could easily corrupt the maze by accidentally crossing the invisible line
into the next line of data, so be careful!


Assorted things
---------------
From start to end, a maze's uncompressed size MUST be divisible by 14.

Every time you change a repeat byte, you must be able to compensate for the
change. For example, let's say you have two repeat bytes in the same line, one
is 6, the other is 3. If you wanted to change the 6 to a 4, you'd need to
change the 3 to a 5. This will keep the line the same length when it's
uncompressed, keeping the maze engine happy.

Moving the FF's around to change maze sizes is NOT recommended (see point #1).
If you want to shrink a maze, replace the last (or first) few lines of
walls/dots with 00's (but leave the repeat bytes intact). I currently don't
know how to enlarge a maze without messing it up.

You can't really rearrange the mazes a lot, because of the limited space (due
to compression). Perhaps if I figure out some way to expand the ROM...

After hacking a maze, sometimes ghosts will be able to move through a wall
that the Mrs. can't. I'm not sure why this happens.

If you discover anything important that I left out, please tell me. =)
