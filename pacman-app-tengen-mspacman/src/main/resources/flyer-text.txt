36 different mazes to amaze and amuse you!

Ms. Pac-Man's here, and she's totally liberated! She gets to run around in 36 unique, mind-boggling mazes - some small enough to fit on one screen; some so big you'll have to scroll around; some that are mighty strange: and some that are straight out of the arcades!

Even the fruits bounce around, making it that much tougher to get bonus points.

Choose Easy, Normal, Hard or Crazy speeds. Whether you're a beginner or expert, Ms. Pac-Man will have you running ragged. There's even a Pac Booster button to really let her shake those pesky ghosts.

Not included in this clone, but in the original game, you can: Play Ms. Pac-Man by yourself or take turns with a friend. Better yet, two can play at the same time - one as the divine Ms. Pac-Man; the other, as the original Pac-Man!
