/**
 * From the Pac-Man dossier:
 * <p>
 * Commonly referred to as the ghost house or monster pen, this cordoned-off area in the center of the maze is the
 * domain of the four ghosts and off-limits to Pac-Man.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Whenever a level is completed or a life is lost, the ghosts are returned to their starting positions in and around
 * the ghost house before play continues—Blinky is always located just above and outside, while the other three are
 * placed inside: Inky on the left, Pinky in the middle, and Clyde on the right.
 * The pink door on top is used by the ghosts to enter or exit the house. Once a ghost leaves, however, it cannot
 * reenter unless it is first captured by Pac-Man—then the disembodied eyes can return home to be revived.
 * Since Blinky is already on the outside after a level is completed or a life is lost, the only time he can get
 * inside the ghost house is after Pac-Man captures him, and he immediately turns around to leave once revived.
 * That's about all there is to know about Blinky's behavior in terms of the ghost house, but determining when the
 * other three ghosts leave home is an involved process based on several variables and conditions.
 * The rest of this section will deal with them exclusively. Accordingly, any mention of “the ghosts” below refers t
 * o Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, but not Blinky.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first control used to evaluate when the ghosts leave home is a personal counter each ghost retains for
 * tracking the number of dots Pac-Man eats. Each ghost's “dot counter” is reset to zero when a level begins and can
 * only be active when inside the ghost house, but only one ghost's counter can be active at any given time regardless
 * of how many ghosts are inside. The order of preference for choosing which ghost's counter to activate is:
 * Pinky, then Inky, and then Clyde. For every dot Pac-Man eats, the preferred ghost in the house (if any) gets its
 * dot counter increased by one. Each ghost also has a “dot limit” associated with his counter, per level.
 * If the preferred ghost reaches or exceeds his dot limit, it immediately exits the house and its dot counter is
 * deactivated (but not reset). The most-preferred ghost still waiting inside the house (if any) activates its timer
 * at this point and begins counting dots.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pinky's dot limit is always set to zero, causing him to leave home immediately when every level begins.
 * For the first level, Inky has a limit of 30 dots, and Clyde has a limit of 60. This results in Pinky exiting
 * immediately which, in turn, activates Inky's dot counter. His counter must then reach or exceed 30 dots before
 * he can leave the house. Once Inky starts to leave, Clyde's counter (which is still at zero) is activated and
 * starts counting dots. When his counter reaches or exceeds 60, he may exit. On the second level, Inky's dot limit
 * is changed from 30 to zero, while Clyde's is changed from 60 to 50. Inky will exit the house as soon as the level
 * begins from now on. Starting at level three, all the ghosts have a dot limit of zero for the remainder of the game
 * and will leave the ghost house immediately at the start of every level.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Whenever a life is lost, the system disables (but does not reset) the ghosts' individual dot counters and uses
 * a global dot counter instead. This counter is enabled and reset to zero after a life is lost, counting the number
 * of dots eaten from that point forward. The three ghosts inside the house must wait for this special counter to
 * tell them when to leave. Pinky is released when the counter value is equal to 7 and Inky is released when it
 * equals 17. The only way to deactivate the counter is for Clyde to be inside the house when the counter equals 32;
 * otherwise, it will keep counting dots even after the ghost house is empty. If Clyde is present at the
 * appropriate time, the global counter is reset to zero and deactivated, and the ghosts' personal dot limits are
 * re-enabled and used as before for determining when to leave the house (including Clyde who is still in the house
 * at this time).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If dot counters were the only control, Pac-Man could simply stop eating dots early on and keep the ghosts
 * trapped inside the house forever. Consequently, a separate timer control was implemented to handle this case by
 * tracking the amount of time elapsed since Pac-Man has last eaten a dot. This timer is always running but gets
 * reset to zero each time a dot is eaten. Anytime Pac-Man avoids eating dots long enough for the timer to reach
 * its limit, the most-preferred ghost waiting in the ghost house (if any) is forced to leave immediately, and
 * the timer is reset to zero. The same order of preference described above is used by this control as well.
 * The game begins with an initial timer limit of four seconds, but lowers to it to three seconds starting with
 * level five.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The more astute reader may have already noticed there is subtle flaw in this system resulting in a way to
 * keep Pinky, Inky, and Clyde inside the ghost house for a very long time after eating them.
 * The trick involves having to sacrifice a life in order to reset and enable the global dot counter,
 * and then making sure Clyde exits the house before that counter is equal to 32.
 * This is accomplished by avoiding eating dots and waiting for the timer limit to force Clyde out.
 * Once Clyde is moving for the exit, start eating dots again until at least 32 dots have been consumed since
 * the life was lost. Now head for an energizer and gobble up some ghosts. Blinky will leave the house immediately
 * as usual, but the other three ghosts will remain “stuck” inside as long as Pac-Man continues eating dots with
 * sufficient frequency as not to trigger the control timer. Why does this happen?
 * The key lies in how the global dot counter works—it cannot be deactivated if Clyde is outside the house when
 * the counter has a value of 32. By letting the timer force Clyde out before 32 dots are eaten, the global dot
 * counter will keep counting dots instead of deactivating when it reaches 32. Now when the ghosts are eaten by
 * Pac-Man and return home, they will still be using the global dot counter to determine when to leave.
 * As previously described, however, this counter's logic only checks for three values: 7, 17, and 32, and
 * once those numbers are exceeded, the counter has no way to release the ghosts associated with them.
 * The only control left to release the ghosts is the timer which can be easily avoided by eating a dot every
 * so often to reset it.
