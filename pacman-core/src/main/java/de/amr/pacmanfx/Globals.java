     * In fact, Inky may be the most dangerous ghost of all due to his erratic behavior.

     * description is a bit misleading. Clyde is the last ghost to leave the pen and tends to separate himself
     * from the other ghosts by shying away from Pac-Man and doing his own thing when he isn't patrolling his corner
     * of the maze. Although not nearly as dangerous as the other three ghosts, his behavior can seem unpredictable
     * at times and should still be considered a threat.
