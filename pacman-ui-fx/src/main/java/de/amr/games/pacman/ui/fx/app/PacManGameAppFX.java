/**
 * This is the entry point of the Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man games.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The application is structured according to the MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern. The model layer consists
 * of the two game models <code> PacManGame</code> and <code> MsPacManGame</code>. The controller is a finite-state
 * machine which is triggered 60 times per second by the game loop. The user interface listens to game events sent from
 * the controller/model layer. The model and controller layers are decoupled from the user interface. This allow to
 * attach different user interfaces without having to change the controller or model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As a proof of concept I implemented also a (simpler) Swing user interface, see repository
 * <a href="https://github.com/armin-reichert/pacman-ui-swing">Pac-Man Swing UI</a>.
